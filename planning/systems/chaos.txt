The chaos is a storm that is basically responsible for refreshing the areas in the world.

The chaos can occur across the world ~once a month.

It refreshes areas that haven't been visited in a while and spawns / destroyes dungeons.

Towns and important locations have barriers to protect against it.

There could be a massive chaos storm that can even destroy important areas.
