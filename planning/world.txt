<<<WORLD EXPLAINED>>>
The world will be generated in a grid of areas

Clumps of the grid will be split into various biomes

Biomes influence the general theme of an area (types of creatures, plants, etc)

Areas have one major feature (terrain, city, dungeon, etc)

Areas are split into layers that have the main game content (layers are like the floors of a building)

Layers are made of tiles, objects, and creatures
